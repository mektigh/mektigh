👾 I’ve been doing stuff with IT for over 20 years, with passion and curiosity i've become a good consultant and a well knowledged IT person. At the moment I work as a full time IT-Consultant and my passion (hobby 💛) lays with my homelab where I can spin up Docker Containers and learn more about CyberSecurity 🔒.
</br>
</br>
🚀 My dream is would be to learn as much about CyberSecurity and work with that fulltime, maybe when the kids are older.
</br>
</br>
🥷 I am as told really good at what I do and I always fancy a challenge. Hit me up with whatever question you have and I'll try help.
